        "Bonjour, Iâ€™m Louis Ansa, passionate art director & graphic designer. Graduated from <a href='https://www.gobelins.fr' target='_blank' class='About-link' data-emoji='gobelins'>Gobelins</a> school in Paris, I started working in Amsterdam before realising I definitively wanted more sun, thatâ€™s why I spent three years working at <a href='https://www.behance.net/watsondg' target='_blank' class='About-link' data-emoji='watsondg'>Watson DG</a> as an art director where I worked on amazing projects for companies such as Pixar, Disney, A24, Universal, Amazon or Fox Entertainment. Although I had so much fun working on those projects, I needed some time to experiment on my own, thatâ€™s when I decided to go freelance to have more time for side projects and <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/61305199/EveryAlmostDay-Spring-08' class='About-link' data-emoji='experiment'>experimentations</a>",
        "I recently joined the <a href='http://www.makemepulse.com' target='_blank' class='About-link' data-emoji='mmp'>Make Me Pulse</a> team in Paris but Iâ€™m available for side projects, collaborations and cool freelance opportunities!
